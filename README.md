# Spoofify
A simple tool to temporarly change your macs WiFi MAC ADRESS.
This is usefull if you'r in a place with limited free wifi, but you really need stackoverflow to get rid of that one annoying bug.

Usage:
```bash
# Run this:
bash ./spoofify.sh
# Reconnect to the WiFi Hotspot
```

Note:
Currently still need to figure out a way that automatically reconnects to the current wifi device.
